	<p>The US billionaire has set himself the target of improving on the unprecedented success of the past two decades at Stamford Bridge once his takeover is complete.
Boehly plans to continue the investment that has delivered 19 major trophies and seen some of the world’s best players head to the club during the Abramovich years. But he also wants to beat the system, in the manner of Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp.
